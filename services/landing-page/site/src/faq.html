        What exactly is HomeFree?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
        HomeFree is a project with a singular goal: to allow you to control your own data by drastically reducing your
        dependence on big centralized corporate services. The way this is accomplished to to own your own device and host
        your own services. This has been possible for a long time but required a lot of experience and months or years of
        effort to get anywhere close to making this work in a reliable and usable way.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the process of building a self-hosted setup at home, the realiztion dawned that all the pieces are now
        available and commoditized, but there is no easy way to stitch them together and no easy way to configure them.
        HomeFree aims to solve this by being very specific about choosing the right configuration and curating a
        set of applications to cut through the endless choice and inconsistency of currently available systems, and
        adding a single UI with a standard design language and single login to access them all.

        How does it differ from other available solutions?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
        There are similar systems out there but they are all missing important pieces of the puzzles to make a self-hosted
        system simple and turnkey. A goal is to be able to provide a elegant Apple-like design experience in a small box with
        built-in battery backup and redundant storage that you plug directly into your modem and replaces your
        router, NAS, home server, and WiFi access point, all through a short installation process to be up and running in minutes.

        What types of things can I do with HomeFree?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Almost everything that is provided by Google and other large tech companies could be a target for inclusion
        in HomeFree. Services that are already included or are in work:
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Photo hosting</li>
          <li>Calendar</li>
          <li>Contacts</li>
          <li>Office Suite</li>
          <li>File Storage</li>
          <li>Video and Audio Serving</li>
          <li>Home Automation</li>
          <li>Video surveilance</li>
          <li>Website/Blog</li>
          <li>Ad Blocking</li>
          <li>Password Managemenet</li>
          <li>Browser Bookmark Sync</li>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        Can I access my server away from home?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Yes! That's one of the core goals of HomeFree - to provide public facing services and access so that
        you don't have to rely on large centralized services. You can configure various services to be private
        to your home or open to the internet. For services that are private, you can access them remotely by
        connecting to HomeFree through a built-in VPN.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        What are more cutting edge ideas that could be implemented?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Anything that could run on a computer or be run as a service could be hosted by HomeFree. The goal is to make
        adding modules standard and plug-and-play. AI, privacy, and decentralization are themes that could be explored.
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li>External GPU plugin for AI services. Could cluster GPUs with friends, family, or even strangers</li>
          <li>Decentralized social media nodes such as Bluesky and Mastadon</li>
          <li>Decentralized CDNs for high traffic sites and services</li>
          <li>Shared back-up services between friends and family</li>
          <li>Cryptocurrency (though nothing about HomeFree is currently related to or dependency on a blockchain)</li>
          <li>Pluggable DNA sequencing module for those who don't want to use a public DNA sequencing service</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        Is HomeFree FREE?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Yes, it is free in both major senses of the word - it is open source, so you can install and modify it
        as you please. It is also free to use, without payment.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        A stated goal of HomeFree is to be easy to set up. How can this be with the complexities around domain registration,
        dynamically allocated IPs, and the complexities of various ISP deployments?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Making these easy are core goals of the project, and the vision is to make them as automatic as possible.  The easiest route
        would be a web-gui or phone app based configuration that does the following:
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Detect the ISP and automatically configure appropriately</li>
          <li>Provide simple insructions on any changes required to the modem configuration, if necessary</li>
          <li>Longer term, look at spearheading a movement for zero-config ISP/modem setup for self hosting</li>
          <li>Provide a dynamic DNS service with subdomains at homefree.host for zero-effort setup</li>
          <li>If a personal domain is desired, provide a simple step-by-tep UI-based config</li>
          <li>For personal domains, detect the registrar, and offer custom instructions for setting up dynamic dns</li>
          <li>Longer term, look at protocols/APIs for automatically configuring registrars</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        What about email? Isn't that very hard to self-host?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        It's well know among the self-hosting community that email can be fragile and difficult to self-host for various reasons. The
        great thing about HomeFree is that it's not all or nothing. You can progressively decide which services you want to host and
        which you want to continue to use elsewhere.  But there are still plans to offer the ability to host an email server if you
        so wish. For an example of a simple US for setting up a custom domain for secure and reliable email, look at Proton Mail's
        domain configuration UI.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        What is preventing me from losing all my data if the hardware fails or my house burns down?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        The system is designed to store all data in a way that is easy to bundle and back-up to another machine
        in your location and off-site as well.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        What if I am in the process of moving or don't want to host a server at my location anymore?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        The backup data bundle is in a standard format and can easily be moved to another HomeFree server or
        an online HomeFree-compatible service if you do not want to continue hosting yourself.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        How do I ensure that access to my services is reliable when I am using it away from home?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        This problem is still under consideration. One potential solution is to share load across multiple HomeFree
        servers, either through friends and family, or a more open anonymous distributed CDN of some sort. Also,
        paid-for services could be offered that provide a back-up in case your server goes down or is otherwise
        out of service.
