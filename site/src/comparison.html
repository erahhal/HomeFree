  <div class="section">
    There are similar systems out there but they are all missing important pieces of the puzzles to make a self-hosted
    system simple and turnkey. A goal is to be able to provide a elegant Apple-like design experience in a small box with
    built-in battery backup and redundant storage that you plug into your modem instead of a router, and go through a
    short installation process and be up and running in minutes. There is currently no other product that does all of
    the following out of the box without heavy technical lifting.
    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>Router/Gateway</li>
      <li>Firewall</li>
      <li>Wireless Access Point</li>
      <li>Ad Blocking</li>
      <li>Dynamic DNS</li>
      <li>Reverse Proxy with automatic certificate management</li>

    <h2>OPNSense/PFSense</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://opnsense.org/" target="_blank">OPNSense</a> and <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/" target="_blank">PFSense</a>
      are popular Open Source router products that can replace a typical router/access point provided
      by an ISP, with a lot of additional functionality like firewall functionality, ad blocking, intrusion detection,
      etc. These products can be used at home, but are rather technical and complicated, requiring a lot of configuration.
      They are also not very suitable for serving general applications.

    <h2>Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://store.ui.com/us/en/products/udm-pro" target="_blank">Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro</a> is a
      similar product to OPNSense, but with a highly polished front-end.  It is a corporate product, and as such is
      not free, nor is it open source. It also does not work well with other network hardware that is not part of the
      Ubiquiti ecosystem. It is also a relatively complex product that requires a level of technical understanding.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Synology</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.synology.com" target="_blank">Synology</a> offers a wide range of products that began with
      NAS (Network-Attached Storage) but has extended into offering the ability to run applications in docker containers.
      Since they are first and formost network storage devices, they often don't come with much memory and CPU power,
      so are not well suited to heavy application usage. Thye also are expensive and not open source, and not purpose
      built as routers for WAN facing applications.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>TrueNAS</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.truenas.com/" target="_blank">TrueNAS</a> TrueNAS covers a similar NAS space to Synology,
      but with an open source offering. Being open source, it can be run on better hardware and can more suitably serve
      applications, but is not purpose built as a router, and would require heavy configuration to work as one.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>CasaOS and Umbrel</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://casaos.io/" target="_blank">CasaOS</a> and <a href="https://umbrel.com/" target="_blank">Umbrel</a>
      are focused on serving applications as a first class concern, but less capable in routing
      and gateway capability, which would need to be configured separately. From a user experience perspective though,
      they are closer to what HomeFree is trying to achieve.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>NextCloud and YunoHost</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank">NextCloud</a> and <a href="https://yunohost.org/" target="_blank">YunoHost</a>
      are heavy multi-purpose web platforms with a built-in suite of applications. They serve a more narrow niche than CasaOS
      and Umbrel as they cannot run arbitrary applications, but rather those built specifically for the NextCloud ecosystem.
