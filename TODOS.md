TODOS
=====

* Make a flake that sets up host machine for dev
* Setup host so default network virbr0 starts at boot
  * currently need to us "sudo virsh net-start --network default"
* Does hardware-configuration.nix root disk device need to be updated with each build?
* Get VM starting from command line - export XML?
* Figure out way to setup SSH without needing to lookup IP in virt-manager
* Figure out how to use host id_rsa.pub in build, rather than hard-coded key
